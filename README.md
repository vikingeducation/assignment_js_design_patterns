#How to Play:
In order to play this classic memory game load the page, then enter the size of the board you'd like to play with. 

**NOTE:** There are no validations on the size of the board right now other than it being square. If you enter an odd number then you won't be able to win the game so for now please only enter an even number.

Once you've selected the board size the game will render. Then, select pairs of cards to have them flip over, revealing their number. If the two numbers match then the cells will turn green and your score will increase by 30. If they don't, the cards will flip back over and your score will decrease by 10 points. 

REMEMBER WHERE THE CARDS WERE! It will make it easier to win after you've lost a few times :)
